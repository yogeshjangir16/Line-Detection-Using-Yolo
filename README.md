# Line Detection in Historical Indic Manuscripts

This project focuses on line detection in historical Indic manuscripts using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically YOLOv11 and YOLO-NAS. The models were evaluated on datasets containing Khmer, Sundanese, and Balinese manuscripts to address challenges such as noise, skew, and overlapping lines.
